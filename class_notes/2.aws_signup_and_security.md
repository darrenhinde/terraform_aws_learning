#Sign Up for AWS 
Use the following [link](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) to create a free account 

##After creating the AWS account
Create a IAM user account to limit risk. Never use your root account as commonly used account.
Use Multi factoral authentication.

To enable **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** go to your account (top right) then go to *Security Credentials* then enable it.

--------
####Give Billing Information acess to IAM Users:
Once setup the last thing to do is enable the IAM users to see billing information. On your root account go to account page then to the **IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information** section and activate IAM see billing information. 

-----------------
##Create an IAM user account 
Go to *IAM* application, in here we will create a new policy for our new users. Select the **Policies** option

We are going to create a new policy but instead of using the gui we going to use this [code](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_examples_aws_my-sec-creds-self-manage.html) made by aws to create a new policy.

We are going to use a slightly modified version of this in the form as:

After copy and pasting the json policy in follow the steps and give it a descriptive name such as: **Force MFA on adminstrator accounts on AWS**

###Make A User Group
Go to group and add a Group called Admins then add policies to the group. 
The Two policies that we are going to add to this group are the **AdministratorAccess** and our newly created policy. 

###Create a new User
Go to Users -> Add user
- Create user name and password
- Add the User to the new user group

Tags can be add so users can be grouped by their tags. 

<br>
The User won't be able to make any new serices until he has setup a MFA account. 

![](images/aws_do_not_have_permission_users.PNG)

Same as before add MFA device and set it up. 

Once set up relog in with MFA to get all Admin permisions

#AWS Vault 
Go to IAM -> Users -> Security Credentials -> Create Access key
![](images/access_key.PNG)

Open a terminal and run 
~~~ 
aws-vault add username 
~~~
When promped set the username and secret key into aws vault

Then we need to add the MFA to our aws vault. Let's look at the settings
~~~
vi ~/.aws/config
~~~ 
Then in that file we will add the region and the Assigned MFA device number (look at picture above). 
The file should look like:

~~~
[profile darren.hinde]
region=us-east-1
mfa_serial=arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXXXXXX:mfa/darren.hinde
~~~

Lets test this credentials by 
~~~
aws-vault exec darren.hinde --duration=12h
~~~
Can customize the token length by adding --duration=12h

If you using windows you need to use the following: 
~~~
aws-vault exec darren.hinde --duration=12h -- cmd.exe
~~~

This console now has access to AWS with a token which we can use to deploy infastructure through terraform
